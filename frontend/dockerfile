# Step 1: Use Node.js as the base image
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy only package.json and package-lock.json to leverage Docker caching
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Install all dependencies, including devDependencies (required for TypeScript build)
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Set API_URL at build time and provide a fallback
ARG API_URL=https://example.com
ENV VITE_API_URL=$API_URL

# Build the React app
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Serve the static files with `serve`
RUN npm install -g serve

# Expose the port for the frontend
EXPOSE 80

# Command to serve the React app on port 80 and bind to 0.0.0.0
CMD ["serve", "-s", "build", "-l", "80", "--single"]
